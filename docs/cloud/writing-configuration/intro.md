# Writing good configuration

As a Cloud Engineer at Bulder Bank, I spend a great deal of time expressing my desires through declarative code.
The motivation behind this series of articles is to share some of the things I've learnt about being declarative.
In the first article, I describe what I mean by being *configuration oriented*, and why I think its important.
In the subsequent articles, I give practical examples of configuration oriented approaches to working with some of my favorite tools.
